# Flattened Data-Parallel Generation of Cubic Bezier Curves

This application demonstrates the use of the _flattening by expansion_
technique [1] for drawing cubic bezier curves. The application is
written in [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org) and builds on the
[Futhark Lys Library](https://github.com/diku-dk/lys).

## Running it

To build and run the application, do as follows:

````
$ futhark pkg sync
$ make
$ ./bezier -i
````

## Future Work

By splitting the curves appropriately, we may be able to predict
better the exact number of pixels required to draw a continuous
line. It would also be great to see some antialiasing implemented.
